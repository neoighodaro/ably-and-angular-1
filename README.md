### Requirements
- Have knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- Know JavaScript and Angular 1.
- An Ably API Key. Go [here to get yours](https://ably.io).
- Basic knowledge of CLI.

## Setup
You would need to clone this repo and add your API key to the document. Go to your `terminal` and run the following commands:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/neoighodaro/ably-and-angular-1.git appname
$ cd appname
```

Update `ABLY_API_KEY` in both HTML files. Once you are done, we are set to run this tutorial. Feel free to use any editor of your choice to edit both files.

If you have PHP setup locally, then you can easily create a PHP server like this:

```shell
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Go to your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to see the app.

That's it.
